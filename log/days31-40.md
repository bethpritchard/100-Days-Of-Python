**Today's progress:** Finished flash card app, and made log manager which can produce 10 days of logs for 100 Days of 
Code! Super useful.
    
**Today I've learned about:** TKinter, CSVs, Pandas
    
**Thoughts:** I feel so clever doing log manager. First time I've felt like I've made something really useful.
