# 100 Days of Code

## What is 100 Days of Code?
It is what it says on the tin - 100 days of code! The project was founded by [Alex Kallaway](https://twitter.com/ka11away)
and you can fork his [repo](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) if you decide to take part!


## Rules
1. Code for at least an hour a day, every day
2. Work on real projects, not just tutorials.
