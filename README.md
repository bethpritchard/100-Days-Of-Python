## Why 100 Days of Code?

As a final year maths student I don't do a massive amount of programming in my course, and when I do use in R is designed just to get the results, rather than write good, clean code. 

I want to become a software developer after university, and so I am learning Python as my first proper language. 

I did the Code First: Girls Intro. to Python course in September 2020 which kickstarted my learning.
