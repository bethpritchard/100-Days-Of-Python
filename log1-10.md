# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2nd January, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did chapter 3 and chapter 4 in Automate The Boring Stuff - did the small projects at the end of the chapters.

**Thoughts:** Learned about Try/Except, and flow control. Need to work on break/continue and flow control, then focus on classes.

### Day 2: 3rd January, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Read through Chapter 5 ATBS, completed chess validator end of chapter project.

**Thoughts:** Feeling more confident with dictionaries. Flow control still needs work.

### Day 3: 4th January, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Did second mini project of CH5 ATBS

**Thoughts:** Tired today as spend all morning preparing for coding test for interview (smashed it though!). Will try and do coding in the morning tomorrow instead of leaving it until late.

### Day 4: 5th January, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent all morning going over slicing strings. Read throug CH6 ATBS. Followed along with the practice project and got sucked into the comp sci side of things, trying to get batch files to work... no success! 

**Thoughts:** Need to get cracking with the actual projects tomorrow! Definitely want to learn more about computer science though.

### Day 5: 6th January, 2021

**Today's Progress**: CH7 ATBS and print table project. Learned about formatting strings.

**Thoughts:** Definitely need to move onto something more stretching!

### Day 6: 7th January, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Completed date validator.

**Thoughts:** Didn't really feel like coding as barely slept and had an interview but I had a beer and perservered and made something quite fun. I'm still stuck doing mostly for loops and if loops so I need to find something more challenging, possibly using classes as I've not used them much.

### Day 10: 11th January, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Day 15 of 100DOP course. Started the coffee machine simulator project.

**Thoughts:** This project is a lot more complex than I first thought! I've made use of Pycharms TODO system. I've enjoyed breaking this down into small chunks.
